This is just a simple minimal export of a Neos 4 Cms Backend Module
- to be used to develop an own Backend-Module *with* the present Neos Styles.

(usefull for early state to insert a svelte app)

*I made this public as a simple STRG+S wont save all the correct files and is to bloated. I maybe will version this for Neos Versions.*
